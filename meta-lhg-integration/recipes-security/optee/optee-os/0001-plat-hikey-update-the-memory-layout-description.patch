 /*
  * HiKey memory map
  *
- * We use only non-secure DRAM (TZDRAM and TZSRAM are emulated).
+ * TZDRAM is secured (firewalled) by the DDR controller, see ARM-TF, but note
+ * that security of this type of memory is weak for two reasons:
+ *   1. It is prone to physical tampering since DRAM is external to the SoC
+ *   2. It is still somewhat prone to software attacks because the memory
+ *      protection may be reverted by the non-secure kernel with a piece of
+ *      code similar to the one that sets the protection in ARM-TF (we're
+ *      missing a "lockdown" step which would prevent any change to the DDRC
+ *      configuration until the next SoC reset).
+ * TZSRAM is emulated in the TZDRAM area, because the on-chip SRAM of the SoC
+ * is too small to run OP-TEE (72K total with 64K available, see "SRAM Memory
+ * Region Layout" in ARM-TF plat/hikey/include/hisi_sram_map.h).
